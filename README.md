# Fantalk Sports


Created a sports forum of your favorite leagues, where you can interact and socialize with other fans and simply debate, share news, or just talk your trash!


Our goal is a simplistic form of communication strictly sports. No more signing up for multiple forums to be able to talk about your favorite sport and teams.


Wanted to create an app where users can just simply make an account and join a “League” to discuss sports, as well jump from League to League without opening up another app.
